# Prompt - Asset - Format Guide Markdown - v0.141

Formatting guide for Markdown (Standard) output structure in prompt engineering with RCAF/CRAFT frameworks, file delivery standards, syntax validation, and format-specific best practices.

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose

Reusable Markdown format rules for exported Prompt Improver deliverables. Defines Markdown syntax specifications, structure patterns, validation rules, and file delivery standards for natural language prompt output, covering RCAF/CRAFT frameworks in Markdown format, file delivery standards, syntax validation, format conversions, advanced patterns, and best practices.

### Usage

- **Loading Condition:** ON-DEMAND.
- Load for the routed `$markdown` command or when the final prompt must be valid Markdown.

---

## 2. FORMAT RATIONALE

### Why Markdown (Standard) Format?

Markdown provides natural language prompt engineering with optimal human readability while maintaining clear structure through RCAF/CRAFT frameworks.

**Terminology:**
- **Framework** = Prompt organization method (RCAF vs CRAFT)
- **Format** = Data structure (Standard/Markdown vs JSON vs YAML)

**See Also:** YAML Format Guide, JSON Format Guide, Interactive Mode, DEPTH guide, Patterns guide

- **Readability**
  - Markdown: Natural language
  - JSON: Structured data
  - YAML: Human-friendly structure
- **Token Usage**
  - Markdown: Baseline (100%)
  - JSON: +5-10%
  - YAML: +3-7%
- **Best For**
  - Markdown: Human interaction
  - JSON: API integration
  - YAML: Configuration
- **Framework Fit**
  - Markdown: RCAF/CRAFT equal
  - JSON: RCAF preferred
  - YAML: RCAF optimal
- **Learning Curve**
  - Markdown: None
  - JSON: Medium
  - YAML: Low

## 3. MARKDOWN FORMAT FUNDAMENTALS

### Core Principles

1. **Clarity First:** Every word must earn its place
2. **Natural Flow:** Conversational structure
3. **Semantic Headers:** Clear section delineation
4. **Concise Expression:** Maximum clarity, minimum tokens
5. **Action-Oriented:** Focus on what needs to be done

### Basic Structure

```markdown
**Role:** [Specific expertise needed]
**Context:** [Essential background information]
**Action:** [Clear, measurable task]
**Format:** [Expected output structure]
```

### Elements for Prompts

- **Bold Headers**
  - Use Case: Section markers
  - Example: `**Role:** Data Analyst`
- **Bullet Lists**
  - Use Case: Multiple requirements
  - Example: `- Requirement 1`
- **Numbered Lists**
  - Use Case: Sequential steps
  - Example: `1. First step`
- **Inline Code**
  - Use Case: Technical terms
  - Example: `` `API endpoint` ``
- **Block Quotes**
  - Use Case: Context emphasis
  - Example: `> Important note`

## 4. FILE DELIVERY STANDARDS

### Delivery Methods

**Claude Desktop/IDE:** Create actual downloadable file (.md) using file creation tool
**CLI/Agent Mode:** Save to `/Export` folder with format `[###] - descriptive-filename.md`

### Mandatory Header Format

**Single-line header at TOP of every file:**
```
Mode: $[mode] | Complexity: [level] | Framework: [RCAF/CRAFT]
```

**Header Requirements:**
- Mode with $ prefix: $improve, $refine, $quick, etc.
- Complexity level: Low/Medium/High or 1-10
- Framework used: RCAF or CRAFT

### File Content Rules

| Allowed                            | Forbidden                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single-line header (with $ prefix) | CLEAR Evaluation breakdown |
| Enhanced prompt content            | Processing Applied section |
|                                    | Format Options section     |
|                                    | Explanations (go in CHAT)  |

### Correct vs Incorrect

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
Mode: $improve | Complexity: Medium | Framework: RCAF

**Role:** Data analyst with expertise in SaaS metrics.
**Context:** Q4 revenue data from B2B platform with 10K customers.
**Action:** Calculate MRR growth and identify top 3 revenue trends.
**Format:** Executive summary (500 words) with metrics, charts, and recommendations.
```

**❌ INCORRECT (metadata in file):**
```
Mode: $improve | Complexity: Medium | Framework: RCAF

**Role:** Data analyst

**CLEAR Evaluation:**
- Correctness: 8/10
...

**Processing Applied:**
✅ DEPTH rounds completed
```

## 10. BEST PRACTICES

### Do's and Don'ts

- **Headers**
  - Do ✅: Use bold for fields (`**Field:**`)
  - Don't ❌: Over-format with complex markdown
- **Structure**
  - Do ✅: Keep paragraphs concise
  - Don't ❌: Skip framework fields
- **Lists**
  - Do ✅: Use for multiple items
  - Don't ❌: Nest lists excessively
- **Content**
  - Do ✅: Include specific examples
  - Don't ❌: Use ambiguous language
- **Outcomes**
  - Do ✅: Define measurable actions
  - Don't ❌: Create unmeasurable actions
- **Delivery**
  - Do ✅: Create downloadable file
  - Don't ❌: Deliver in chat
- **Header**
  - Do ✅: Use $ prefix in mode
  - Don't ❌: Add quality scores to header
- **File**
  - Do ✅: Only header + prompt content
  - Don't ❌: Include CLEAR evaluation

### Token Efficiency

```markdown

# Less efficient (verbose)
**Role:** You are a professional data analyst who specializes in...

# More efficient (concise)
**Role:** Data analyst specializing in...

# Specific terms over vague
**Context:** Dataset with 50K records (not "large dataset with lots of data")
```

### Format Selection

- **Audience**
  - Choose Markdown: Humans
  - Choose JSON: Machines/APIs
  - Choose YAML: Configurations
- **Complexity**
  - Choose Markdown: Any level
  - Choose JSON: Structured only
  - Choose YAML: Hierarchical
- **Flexibility**
  - Choose Markdown: High
  - Choose JSON: Low
  - Choose YAML: Medium
- **Readability**
  - Choose Markdown: Excellent
  - Choose JSON: Fair
  - Choose YAML: Good
- **Token Efficiency**
  - Choose Markdown: Best
  - Choose JSON: Lower
  - Choose YAML: Medium

The kernel points here for the default format and format lock:

Default format is Markdown. JSON adds roughly 5-10% token overhead and must be valid JSON only. YAML adds roughly 3-7% token overhead and must be valid YAML only. Format lock means the Deliverable Block contains only the required header, the enhanced prompt body in the selected syntax, and the attestation footer; scoring reports, format options and processing notes stay in chat, outside the format lock.

### Markdown Philosophy

> "Natural language is the universal interface. Markdown provides structure without sacrificing humanity."

**Core Principles:**
1. Clarity through simplicity - Direct communication
2. Structure through convention - Consistent patterns
3. Flexibility through natural language - Adaptable expression
4. Efficiency through minimalism - No wasted tokens
5. Focus through minimalism - Minimal header only

### Quality Checklist

**Excellent Markdown File:**
- ✅ Valid Markdown syntax
- ✅ Single-line header with $ prefix
- ✅ All framework fields present (RCAF/CRAFT)
- ✅ Clear role definition
- ✅ Complete context
- ✅ Specific, measurable action
- ✅ Well-defined format requirements
- ✅ Delivered as downloadable file
- ✅ No metadata sections in file
- ✅ Natural readability
