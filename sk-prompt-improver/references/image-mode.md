# Prompt - Templates - Image Mode - v0.123

Specialized mode for optimizing prompts for AI image generators including Flux 2 Pro, Google Imagen 4 (Nano Banana Pro), Runway, Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, Seedream, Leonardo, and Ideogram.

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose

Transform vague visual requests into structured, platform-optimized image prompts using the FRAME framework and VISUAL scoring system.

### When to Use

- **Loading Condition:** TRIGGER. Activated by `$image` / `$img` commands.
- Image generation prompts and platform-specific optimization.
- Composition vocabulary, style references, and anti-pattern detection.

---

## 2. OBJECTIVE

Transform vague visual descriptions into detailed, evocative prompts optimized for AI image generators.

**Commands:** `$image`, `$img`
**DEPTH Rounds:** 5 (creative iteration)
**Framework:** FRAME
**Scoring:** VISUAL (60 points, 48+ threshold)

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Describe what you see, feel, and sense—not what you want the AI to figure out."

**Key Principles:**
1. **Subject first** - Lead with the main focus, add context after
2. **Specificity over abstraction** - "Golden retriever puppy" not "dog"
3. **No negative prompts on newer models** - Flux 2 Pro, Imagen 4 ignore them
4. **Natural language** - Modern models prefer conversational prompts
5. **Platform awareness** - Each generator has unique syntax and strengths
6. **Reference images** - Use when available for consistency (multi-reference supported)

The kernel points here for the negative-prompt prohibition:

10. NEVER include negative prompts on platforms that ignore them; use positive rephrasing where required.

frame_process:
  round_1_discover:
    - Identify primary subject
    - Detect platform hints

  "landscape" → "wide shot landscape at golden hour, dramatic clouds, leading lines"
  "product" → "product photography on white seamless, soft box lighting, sharp focus"
  "fantasy" → "epic fantasy illustration, dramatic lighting, detailed environment"
  "modern" → "contemporary minimalist aesthetic, clean lines, muted color palette"
  "vintage" → "1970s Kodachrome aesthetic, warm tones, subtle grain"

  - Typical Adjustments: Specific elements, fine-tuning

**Platform-Specific Refinement Tips:**

| Platform   | Common Refinements                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Midjourney | Adjust `--s` value, add `--style raw`, change `--ar`   |
| Flux       | Increase specificity, add scene details                |
| DALL-E     | Restructure paragraph flow, emphasize key elements     |
| SD         | Adjust weights `(element:1.3)`, expand negative prompt |

**Convergence Signal:** When user expresses satisfaction:

```markdown
The image matches your vision! 🎯

Save this final prompt for future use:
[Final optimized prompt]
