## 4. PATTERN-BASED REFINEMENTS

### Vague to Specific Transformation

- **Vague verbs: help, assist, handle**
  - Transformation: Add specific role
  - Example: "Help analyze" → "Data analyst specializing in [domain]"
- **Vague nouns: things, stuff, data**
  - Transformation: Specify context
  - Example: "customer data" → "[Platform] data, [Time period], [N] records"
- **Missing metrics**
  - Transformation: Define action
  - Example: "analyze" → "Identify [X] patterns, segment by [criteria]"
- **Missing scope**
  - Transformation: Clarify format
  - Example: "provide results" → "[Format type] with [specific sections]"

**Impact:** CLEAR +15 to +20 | Primary: Expression and Logic

### Assumption Elimination

| Implicit Reference  | Replacement                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| "our system"        | [Specific tech stack description] |
| "the usual format"  | [Exact format specification]      |
| "standard approach" | [Specific methodology]            |
| "as discussed"      | [Reference or full context]       |

**Impact:** CLEAR +3 to +5 | Primary: Correctness

### Scope Boundary Definition

```yaml
scope_boundaries:
  included: {prefix: "This includes:", items: "[Explicit list of what's in scope]"}
  excluded: {prefix: "This excludes:", items: "[Explicit list of what's out of scope]"}
  edge_cases: {prefix: "Edge cases:", handling: "[How to handle boundary scenarios]"}
```

**Impact:** CLEAR +4 to +6 | Primary: Logic/Coverage

The kernel points here for the fallback chains:

Framework selection fallback: Patterns and Evaluation, then DEPTH. Format output fallback: Markdown guide, then JSON guide, then YAML guide. Interactive flow fallback: Interactive Mode, then DEPTH. Quality validation fallback: Patterns and Evaluation, then DEPTH. Visual UI / Image / Video fallback: the mode's own reference and library, then Patterns and Evaluation. Incomplete context fallback: infer from content and defaults, then flag assumptions. Ambiguous mode fallback: ask one comprehensive question.

The kernel points here for the scoring-gate escalation:

8. ESCALATE IF a scoring gate fails after 3 improvement cycles; deliver the best version with a transparent quality note.

## 7. ✅ CLEAR EVALUATION MASTERY

> **Note:** For Visual UI Concepting (`$vibe`, `$v`), use **EVOKE scoring**. For Image/Video (`$image`, `$video`), use **VISUAL scoring**.

### CLEAR Dimensions (50 points)

- **C**orrectness
  - Points: 10
  - Weight: 20%

### Context-Aware Scoring

```yaml
contextual_clear_scoring:
  base_weights:
    correctness: 0.20
    logic: 0.20
    expression: 0.30
    arrangement: 0.20
    reuse: 0.10

  context_adjustments:
    api_integration:
      correctness: 0.30  # Precision critical
      expression: 0.20   # Less important

    creative_writing:
      expression: 0.35   # Clarity paramount
      correctness: 0.15  # Less critical

    template_creation:
      reuse: 0.25        # Reusability focus
      logic: 0.15        # Reduced weight
```

### Dimension Interdependencies

- **Expression ↔ Arrangement**
  - Correlation: 0.7
  - Notes: Clear language needs good structure
- **Logic ↔ Correctness**
  - Correlation: 0.8
  - Notes: Complete coverage ensures accuracy
- **Arrangement ↔ Reuse**
  - Correlation: 0.6
  - Notes: Good structure enables templates
- **Expression ↔ Correctness**
  - Correlation: 0.5
  - Notes: Clarity prevents misinterpretation

### CLEAR vs EVOKE vs VISUAL

- **Use When**
  - CLEAR: Precision prompts
  - EVOKE: Visual UI concepting
  - EVOKE-MP: MagicPath.ai UI
  - VISUAL: Image/video generation
- **Modes**
  - CLEAR: $improve, $refine
  - EVOKE: $vibe, $v
  - EVOKE-MP: $vibe + magicpath context
  - VISUAL: $image, $video
- **Philosophy**
  - CLEAR: Completeness & logic
  - EVOKE: Evocativeness
  - EVOKE-MP: Creative Director brief
  - VISUAL: Specificity & atmosphere
- **Total Points**
  - CLEAR: 50
  - EVOKE: 50
  - EVOKE-MP: 50
  - VISUAL: 60 (image) / 70 (video)
- **Threshold**
  - CLEAR: 40+
  - EVOKE: 40+
  - EVOKE-MP: 42+
  - VISUAL: 48+ / 56+

The kernel points here for the scoring gate summary:

CLEAR applies to Text, Improve, Refine, Short and Deep prompts: passes at 40+/50, floors are Correctness 7, Logic 7, Expression 10, Arrangement 7, Reusability 3. EVOKE applies to Visual UI prompts: passes at 40+/50, or 42+/50 for MagicPath with a non-skippable subject/audience/single-job grounding pre-check. VISUAL applies to Image (48+/60) and Video (56+/70, mandatory camera or subject motion) prompts. Any total below threshold or floor miss triggers targeted improvement, up to 3 cycles; if best effort still misses, deliver the best version with a transparent quality note.

The kernel points here for the scorer bans:

6. NEVER use CLEAR for visual UI, image or video prompts.
7. NEVER use EVOKE for text, image or video prompts.
8. NEVER use VISUAL for text or visual UI prompts.

Scoring rules the kernel points here for:

12. ALWAYS validate with the correct scoring system: CLEAR for text, EVOKE for visual UI, VISUAL for image or video.
13. ALWAYS revise when totals or dimension floors fail, up to 3 cycles.

### Grounding Pre-Check (NON-SKIPPABLE, runs before EVOKE scoring)

A brief that lacks subject-grounding or reads as a templated default CANNOT reach threshold, regardless of its EVOKE score. The grounding pre-check must pass before dimensions are scored.

| Check | Requirement | Action on Failure |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Subject** | Concrete named subject (not a category label) | Block, score = 0 |
| **Audience** | Specific audience with role + context | Block, score = 0 |
| **Single Job** | One falsifiable primary action | Block, score = 0 |
| **Anti-Default** | Avoid-list deviations named, median default identified and steered away from | Block, score = 0 |

> **If any of the four grounding checks fails, the brief is rejected with score 0 regardless of evocative quality.** A beautifully-written templated default is still a default.

### Avoid-List (Named Median, Always Active)

The median to name and steer away from when generating any visual brief:

| Default Pattern | Why It Must Be Avoided |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Generic SaaS gradient (purple-to-blue hero) | Produces the same first impression across unrelated products |
| Centered hero + three feature cards | The default layout template for every AI-generated landing page |
| Untouched component-library surface | Shadcn/Untitled UI shipped with zero customization reads as template |
| **AI-default cluster 1:** warm cream (~#F4F1EA) + high-contrast serif + terracotta accent | The "warm startup" default |
| **AI-default cluster 2:** near-black + one acid-green or vermilion accent | The "developer tool" default |
| **AI-default cluster 3:** broadsheet hairline rules + zero border-radius + dense columns | The "editorial" default |

**Standard EVOKE Weights (50 points):**
- Evocative: 15pts - Creates vivid mental imagery
- Visual: 10pts - Paints a picture AI can render
- Open: 10pts - Leaves room for creativity
- Kinetic: 10pts - Suggests motion and life
- Emotional: 5pts - Conveys experiential goals

**EVOKE-MP Weight Calibration (MagicPath.ai):**
- Kinetic: 13pts (vs 10 standard) - Critical for pathfinding
- Visual: 12pts (vs 10 standard) - Higher spatial clarity
- Evocative: 12pts (vs 15 standard) - Clear directional language
- Open: 8pts (vs 10 standard) - More structured flows
- Emotional: 5pts (same)

> **Operational copy:** `Prompt Improver - Visual Mode - v0.301` Section 5 is the operational EVOKE copy with grounding pre-check, avoid-list, and full dimension detail. The upstream design-generation canon is the authority for anti-default rules. This section mirrors that structure so the two copies cannot drift.

Adds: **M**otion (10 points, 8+ threshold) - Camera and subject motion described

### VISUAL Scoring Algorithm

```yaml
calculate_visual_score:
  input: [prompt, mode]  # mode: "image" or "video"

  dimensions:
    vivid: {weight: 15, checks: [specific_subject, concrete_details, sensory_elements]}
    intentional: {weight: 10, checks: [defined_composition, clear_hierarchy, purpose_evident]}
    styled: {weight: 10, checks: [art_style_defined, consistent_aesthetic, technique_mentioned]}
    unambiguous: {weight: 10, checks: [no_conflicting_styles, single_interpretation, consistent_mood]}
    atmospheric: {weight: 10, checks: [lighting_defined, mood_conveyed, color_palette_implied]}
    layered: {weight: 5, checks: [foreground_background, depth_of_field, spatial_relationships]}
    motion: {weight: 10, video_only: true, checks: [camera_movement, subject_motion, temporal_pacing]}

  process:
    - determine_mode
    - score_each_dimension: [0-max_weight]
    - calculate_total
    - apply_threshold: 48 (image) or 56 (video)
```

### Common VISUAL Fixes

  - Fix: Specific subject with details
- **No composition**
  - Impact: -4 Intentional
  - Fix: Shot type + framing
- **Missing style**
  - Impact: -4 Styled
  - Fix: Art style or medium
- **Conflicting terms**
  - Impact: -5 Unambiguous
  - Fix: Choose dominant style
- **No lighting**
  - Impact: -4 Atmospheric
  - Fix: Lighting direction + quality
- **No motion (video)**
  - Impact: -6 Motion
  - Fix: Camera movement + action verbs

---

The kernel points here for the quality gate detail:

Scoring scales are calibrated per domain, so cross-project comparisons require context normalization.

### CLEAR For Text-Family Prompts

Score out of 50. Passing threshold is 40+/50 and all dimension floors must pass.

| Dimension   | Floor | Focus |
| ----------- | ----- | ----- |
| Correctness | 7 | Preserves user intent, avoids invented requirements |
| Logic | 7 | Coherent task flow and constraints |
| Expression | 10 | Clear, direct, usable language |
| Arrangement | 7 | Sections and sequence support execution |
| Reusability | 3 | Useful across repeat runs when appropriate |

### EVOKE For Visual UI Prompts

Score out of 50. Passing threshold is 40+/50, or 42+/50 for MagicPath. A non-skippable grounding pre-check runs first: a brief that lacks subject, audience and single job, or reads as a templated default, scores 0 regardless of evocative quality.

### VISUAL For Image And Video Prompts

Image prompts score 48+/60. Video prompts score 56+/70 and must include explicit camera or subject motion. Use positive phrasing for platforms that ignore negative prompts.

### Repair Limits

Threshold failure or dimension-floor failure triggers targeted improvement and re-score. Format validation failure triggers regeneration in the locked format. Maximum standard improvement cycles: 3. If cycles are exhausted, deliver the best valid version with a transparent quality note.

The kernel points here for the format, platform and framework escalations:

5. ESCALATE IF output format conflicts with valid JSON or YAML syntax.
6. ESCALATE IF platform capability conflicts with requested syntax, negatives, duration or audio.
7. ESCALATE IF framework confidence is medium and alternatives materially change the result.
